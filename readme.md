# MH Owned Drugs Labs. (Collect, Craft, Deliver)
- 1: Collect items to craft for your drugs lab.
- 2: Craft items into drugs in your own drugs lab.
- 3: Deliver drugs to customers, There are about 80 locations, but you can add more very easy with the admin menu.
- 4: Only lab owners can access the laptop owner menu, a employe can only access a employe stash if they have a employe lab key.

# Add more drugs labs
- You can add more labs like weed coke and meth so other players can also own a lab.

# Key system
- There is an Owner and employe key, a owner can access all staches but an employe can only access the employe stash.
- You need this key to get access to the lab but also to get access to the stashes and missions.
- When you lose a key you can buy a key by the ped where you found this lab key, when you open this ped menu you can only buy a new owner key.
- Lab owners can buy new keys for employees in the lab owner menu.

# Extra info
- Employees don't get money they get a pay slip when they deliver items or drugs and they have to give this to the owner so the owner can change this in to money.
- There is an employe stash and a owner stash, the owner stash is also for the dealer and shop items, 
- make sure you have items in the owner stash or the shop or dealer is empty and does not work.
- When players collect items and create items in your lab this goes in to the owner stash when the procces is done so players can't steel shit.

# Drugs deliveries
- Weed bricks
- Coke brinks
- Meth baggies

# Dealers locations on the map
- There are dealers on some locations where players can buy drug.
- Make sure your lab owner stash has items, or the menu is empty.

# Npc Thiefs
- On some locations you can be robbed by npc's, but when you kill them you can get your stuff back.
- Beware that the police gets a notify when you kill this npc.

# Edit Config files
- You can edit values in `server/config/sv_config.lua`
- You can edit values in `server/config/labs.lua` like blips and stuff.
- You can edit vehicle storage if you know what you are doing. `server/config/storeage.lua`
- Most stuff is server side, there is no config file for client side.
